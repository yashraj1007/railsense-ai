RailSense AI – Intelligent Railway Monitoring & Incident Response System
📌 Overview

RailSense AI is an AI-powered railway monitoring and incident response platform designed to improve railway safety through autonomous monitoring, anomaly detection, and real-time decision support.

The system continuously analyzes railway operational data such as temperature, vibration, signal status, train speed, and crowd density to identify potential failures before they escalate into major incidents.

Using a multi-agent AI architecture, RailSense AI can:

Monitor railway sensor data
Detect abnormal conditions
Assess risk levels
Generate automated response recommendations
Visualize incidents through an interactive dashboard
Simulate real-world railway fault scenarios
🎯 Problem Statement

Railway systems generate massive amounts of operational data every second. Traditional monitoring systems often rely on manual observation and delayed responses, increasing the risk of accidents, operational disruptions, and maintenance delays.

RailSense AI addresses this challenge by providing:

Early anomaly detection
Automated risk assessment
Real-time incident monitoring
Faster decision support for railway authorities
🚀 Key Features
🤖 Multi-Agent AI Architecture
Monitor Agent
Continuously observes railway sensor readings
Detects abnormal operational conditions
Triggers investigation workflows
Anomaly Detection Agent
Analyzes sensor data
Calculates risk levels
Classifies incidents as Low, Medium, High, or Critical
Supports Claude AI-powered analysis
Response Agent
Generates automated recommendations
Suggests speed restrictions
Recommends maintenance actions
Supports emergency response workflows
🚆 Railway Sensor Simulation

Since real railway infrastructure is not accessible during development, RailSense AI includes a simulation engine capable of generating realistic railway telemetry:

Temperature
Vibration
Signal Status
Train Speed
Crowd Density
⚠️ Fault Injection Engine

Supports simulation of multiple railway emergencies:

Track Failure
Signal Failure
Overspeed Conditions
Crowd Surge Events

This enables safe testing of AI workflows without real-world infrastructure.

📊 Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard

The dashboard provides:

Railway network visualization
Live train monitoring
Incident tracking
Alert management
Agent status monitoring
Operational analytics
🔄 Real-Time Updates

RailSense AI uses WebSocket-based communication to push alerts instantly from the backend to the dashboard without requiring page refreshes.
